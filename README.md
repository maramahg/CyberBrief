# CyberBrief
During my internship at Aramco, the SOC team needed a better way to share cyber reports securely. I developed CyberBrief, a platform where admins can upload and manage reports while granting authorized employees access. The system uses encryption, decryption, and a small-scale PKI to protect sensitive data.
